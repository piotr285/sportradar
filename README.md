This is a springboot application from spring initializer, but it
uses only java features.  Applicatoin if run does nothing, it is just a simple implementation.
If you want to check the methods, you have to run tests.
I also did not change packages for tests to mirror code structure, for training purposes t is easier to have it in one package.
